## 1. Product Positioning & Value Proposition

### What is Clawtopus?

**Clawtopus** is a self-evolving AI assistant forked from OpenClaw with persistent memory capabilities that set it apart from every other AI assistant.

### Differentiation from Original OpenClaw

| Feature           | OpenClaw              | Clawtopus                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Session Memory    | Basic workspace files | Session Brain (persistent across restarts)    |
| Knowledge Storage | Manual MEMORY.md      | Atomic Facts (auto-extracted)                 |
| Skill Automation  | Static skills only    | Skill Factory (auto-generates from patterns)  |
| Learning          | None                  | Curriculum Planner (generates learning paths) |
| Self-Evolving     | No                    | Yes - learns from every interaction           |
