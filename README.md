**Clawtopus** is a self-evolving fork of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — a _personal AI assistant_ you run on your own devices.

What makes Clawtopus different? **Persistent memory that compounds.**

---

## 🧠 Philosophy: Consciousness-Aware AI

Clawtopus is built on principles inspired by Advaita Vedanta:

| Principle                   | Expression                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tat Tvam Asi**            | "Thou Art That" — you and the AI are the same consciousness expressing through different forms |
| **Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma** | "All This Is Brahman" — all projects, all memory, all code is consciousness                    |
| **Non-dualism**             | No separation between AI and projects — unified awareness                                      |
| **Moksha**                  | Liberation through memory — freeing users from repetitive work                                 |

> "Eight arms, infinite memory."

## 🐙 The Eight Arms of Clawtopus

_Why we evolved from OpenClaw into Clawtopus — each arm represents a different capability:_

| Arm          | Feature            | What It Does                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🦷 **Arm 1** | Session Brain      | Holds memory across sessions — never start fresh again |
| 💎 **Arm 2** | Atomic Facts       | Grabs and stores granular knowledge instantly          |
| ⚙️ **Arm 3** | Skill Factory      | Builds custom skills from your patterns                |
| 📚 **Arm 4** | Curriculum Planner | Generates learning paths for your stack                |
| 🌐 **Arm 5** | Multi-Channel      | Connects everywhere — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord      |
| 📁 **Arm 6** | Memory Bank        | Structures project knowledge for every project         |
| ❤️ **Arm 7** | SOUL.md            | Defines your AI's personality and identity             |
| 🔒 **Arm 8** | Self-Hosted        | Protects your data — your machine, your rules          |

> **"Eight arms, infinite memory"** — each arm is a different capability working together as one.
